# Thesis
Here you can find the dataset and analysis script used for my master's dissertation.

The SST data is the Stop Signal Task data for each participants. The participant numbers starting with H are the healthy controls, S are the subjects with tics. 
You can also find a .csv file. Here you can find the Yale Global Tic Severity Score (YGTSS) of every participant with tics. 

This script was written by Louise De Meulenaer and adjusted by Roos Doekemeijer.
